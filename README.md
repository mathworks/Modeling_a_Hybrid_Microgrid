# Modeling a Hybrid Microgrid in Simscape Electrical&trade;

## Getting Started

Instructions on using the content are contained within Modeling_a_Hybrid_Microgrid.mlx.

## The Hybrid Microgrid
The system we are working towards is a hybrid AC/DC microgrid containing traditional rotating machinery, a battery, two fuel cells and a PV array. There is a simple management system that controls the transfer of power between the DC and AC sides.

## Aim of Content
- To learn Simscape Electrical essentials.
- To build confidence in the development and test of interconnected AC and DC system simulation models by incremental creation, test and integration of components covering a range of fidelity levels.
- To provide a platform upon which more detailed system simulations can be created.
- To consider modeling fidelity and how it maps to technology development.
